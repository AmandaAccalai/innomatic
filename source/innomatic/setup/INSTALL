REQUIREMENTS
------------

- PHP >= 5.4
- PHP files upload support enabled
- At least 4M in upload_max_filesize and post_max_size directives in php.ini
- MySQL or PostgreSQL
- PHP support for MySQLi or PostgreSQL
- PHP extensions: zlib
- Optional PHP extensions: Curl, PCNTL, POSIX
- When using Innomatic in multi-tenant mode and database autocreation: a MySQL
  user with database creation grant



INSTALLATION
------------

- Unpack the Innomatic archive, a folder named "innomatic" will be created.
  Inside this folder, you'll find an index.php file and another "innomatic"
  folder ("innomatic/innomatic"), that is the real public folder for Innomatic.
  The index.php file is not a real public Web file, it is the common receiver for
  the public webapps. If the first level Innomatic directory is left Web
  publicly available, the index.php file will redirect the browser to "innomatic"
  subfolder.

- Create a virtual host in your web server configuration for Innomatic public
  folder (innomatic/innomatic), e.g. innomatic.mydomain.com.

- Point your browser to the newly created Innomatic virtual host and follow
  the Web setup procedure.



SETTING UP TENANT WEBAPPS
-------------------------

When you create a new tenant in the Innomatic Root desktop, a webapp folder
for that tenant will be created in the first level Innomatic folder
("innomatic") aside the Innomatic webapp ("innomatic/innomatic").
You should create a virtual host for each webapp directory, if the tenant
is meant to have a public webapp other than the tenant desktop inside Innomatic.



UPGRADE
-------

You must upgrade Innomatic using the Applications panel in the Innomatic
Root desktop. Please use AppCentral to obtain a newer version
or manually upload the Innomatic archive file in the Applications panel just
as if you were installing or upgrading a Innomatic application.

Overwriting your current Innomatic installation with the content of the
Innomatic distribution archive files will result in not recoverable damages.



INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE QUESTIONS
----------------------------------

Q. When I click on the "Next" button at the bottom of the page during "System
check" phase, nothing happens.

A. Check that the Innomatic directories have the right users and permissions.
Typical user/group for Apache is nobody:nogroup or apache:apache. The same
applies for Windows, you must ensure that the directories are writable by the
web server user.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Innomatic hangs after the installation or upgrade of a application.

A. The installation/upgrade process has been interrupted and the lock file
core/temp/upgrading_system has not been removed. Remove it accessing
[Innomatic Web URL]/root/unlock from your browser.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I'm unable to complete the database creation phase during setup.

A. This is likely to be a database permissions problem. You may try making
sure that the specified database user has access to the database not only from
localhost, but also by the IP address and domain name. Then change the default
localhost on the form to your domain. If this doesn'work, you may also try
with 127.0.0.1 as IP address, for certains setup this works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. POST forms with attribute enctype="multipart/form-data" don't pass
parameters.

A. PHP must have file_uploads set to On in php.ini
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Since Innomatic archive size is greater than 2 megabytes I'm unable to
update it in the applications administration page.

A. The standard PHP upload file size limit is set to 2M. Increase it to a value
bigger than the Innomatic archive, e.g.: upload_max_filesize = 8M
