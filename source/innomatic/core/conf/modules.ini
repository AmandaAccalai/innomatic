;;;;;;;;;;;
; WARNING ;
;;;;;;;;;;;
; This is the default settings file for new iConnect Enterprise Application
; Server installations.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; About this file ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; This file controls many aspects of EAS's behavior.  In order for EAS to
; read it, it must be named 'eas.ini'. EAS looks for it in its home
; directory.
;
; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and Lines
; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).
;
; Directives are specified using the following syntax:
; directive = value
; Directive names are *case sensitive* - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.
;
; The value can be a string, a number or one
; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None)
;
; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes.
; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No.
;
; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal
; sign, or by using the None keyword:
;
;  foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string
;  foo = none    ; sets foo to an empty string
;  foo = "none"  ; sets foo to the string 'none'
;
; All the values in the eas.ini-dist file correspond to the builtin
; defaults (that is, if no eas.ini is used, or if you delete these lines,
; the builtin defaults will be identical).
